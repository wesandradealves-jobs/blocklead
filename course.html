                            <p>
                                    Bitcoin is digital money launched in 2009 as a secure system to transfer value across the internet to anyone with a Bitcoin address, without the possibility of the amount or destination being edited by anyone but the sender. 
                                    <br><br>  
                                    For instance, Bitcoin is very similar to email, but it is much more secure. Email allows anyone to send an email anywhere in the world with only the other person’s email address. That means you don’t have to know or trust the person to send them an email because your email is secured with your login/password, and they can’t steal anything from you unless you send it. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, email relies on a specific company to deliver the message. This means the company can refuse to send it, or even edit the contents. Like email, you only need the person’s address to send Bitcoin to them. However, since the contents of a Bitcoin message includes real world value, if a company can change the contents, then it could result in value loss, or restrictions could be placed on who can send and receive money. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Bitcoin solves this problem with the use of math and a unique and complex user password so that the contents of a message can only be sent by the owner, and can only be received by the intended address. This wasn’t a simple problem to solve, and this is why Bitcoin is considered a great invention, allowing humans to exchange value without trusting any entity (i.e. banks) except themselves. In addition, receiving Bitcoin anywhere in the world takes an average of 30 minutes, whereas bank transfers can take days or weeks when international.

                            <p>
                                    Bitcoin is global, meaning it can be used anywhere in the world with internet. Therefore, the usefulness of Bitcoin depends on where the user is. Some parts of the world, like Venezuela, have extremely volatile local currency. In those regions, Bitcoin is one of the only options to protect the value of their earnings. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In addition, such governments have tried to ban Bitcoin, but because it is 
                                    impossible? very difficult? to restrict who can use it, their efforts are primarily in vain. Bitcoin also allows individuals to do business with anywhere in the world, opening more opportunities for work and exchange where governments would try to restrict them in the traditional banking system. Since any amount can be sent with Bitcoin and transfers are generally completed in less than an hour, it is also far more efficient to exchange with Bitcoin than attempt most international 
                                    wire transfers.

                                    You need only a computer, phone, or USB device to store your access to your funds. This means you can have as much money as you like without the approval or oversight of a bank or government. The main thing you need is the knowledge of how to use Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin does cost money to obtain or exchange for other value, so you’ll also need extra funds or value to acquire or exchange it. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Many people choose Bitcoin because they see it as a better alternative to existing centralized economic models. Most government currencies are inflationary, meaning they print more and more without and end in sight. In any system where supply exceeds demand, the overall value will decrease over time. For instance, you may have heard the common story from an older person that in their day, a nickel would buy a candy bar. While the value may drop slowly, your money is worth less over a longer period of time. Bitcoin, however, slowly reduces the rate of new coin production and has a maximum amount that can ever exist, making it deflationary with a maximum of 21 million whole Bitcoins ever existing. The goal is to make Bitcoins more rare, whereas dollars are less rare and generally go down in value over time. Additionally, Bitcoins are divisible and you can own fractions, so if you wish to buy Bitcoin, you can buy as little or as much as you want.

                                    Bitcoin price is not Bitcoin, it is an open market with speculators and individuals who try to predict the value, or simply make profit. It’s important to take a cautious approach to markets as it’s not an instant get rich vehicle, Bitcoin is more a long-term market with potential to grow and with patience may give profit, or you may lose. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    There are three main options to get Bitcoin. An ATM, Person to Person, or an Exchange Service. ATM’s can be pricey but offer easy access for your first purchase. Person to Person should be approached cautiously, and if you don’t know the individual you should take care and schedule a meeting in a public place, like a coffee shop to avoid issues. Exchanges are the primary place and there’s many options now. To find your local ATM you can go to: <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/" title="https://coinatmradar.com/" target="_blank">https://coinatmradar.com/</a>, for in person you can find your local meetup or try a site like <a href="http://localbitcoins.com" title="http://localbitcoins.com" target="_blank">http://localbitcoins.com</a> remaining cautious. There are a number of exchanges available, for now we recommend: itBit, Gemini, Bitstamp, OkEx, Cex.io, Paxful, Unocoin, Huobi and Bitflyer. You may choose another, but depending on where you are in the world these are the best options we suggest.

                                    With Bitcoin, you have the option to hold your own unique access. You can store it locally on your computer or a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. When using exchanges or wallet services that are centralized, you lose the unique property of Bitcoin, which is personal ownership. You should always research companies and make sure they are reputable, and trust them only with what you need there. If you store Bitcoin yourself, it’s important to keep your private key or access code safe. Some wallets offer encryption, like Electrum. If someone gets access to your private key, they can take your Bitcoin. Therefore, the number one way to keep your Bitcoin safe is to protect your private key.

                                Bitcoin uses public/private key encryption. That probably doesn’t mean anything to you. A good way to explain it is cooking. If you bake a cookie, the parts of the recipe are random. What flour, was it organic, who made the flour, what temperature for your oven, the humidity of your kitchen, and any other variable. In order to create that cookie, you would need the exact same recipe and environment. The recipe, including all the unique ingredients and variables, is the “private key”, or password. You could share the cookie with someone and they can taste it and know it’s unique without knowing the recipe, and it would be impossible to recreate the cookie just by seeing and tasting it. The cookie is like your “public key” or public Bitcoin address. It turns out the number of combinations, just as there are many combinations in your kitchen, is so large that it’s impossible to ever create the same cookie (public key) by guessing the exact recipe and variables (private key).
                                <br><br>
                                Now, when you want to send a transaction, it is like adding sprinkles to the cookie. The sprinkles say, “I want to send 1 Bitcoin to another person.” The combination of the sprinkles and the cookie will equal the unique cookie that is impossible to reproduce plus the generic sprinkles that the network knows. The taste of the cookie will have to be exactly the same, except there’s now sprinkles on it. If the cookie tastes even the slightest bit different, someone will be able to tell it’s not the right cookie. By verifying the cookie, the Bitcoin system can always tell it’s you, and your unique one-time homemade recipe, and be able to prove you are the only one with the true recipe and are allowed to send and receive what you own. This is the magic of Bitcoin, and has been used for a long time in computers for security.
